## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node.js typically comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which you will use to manage dependencies.

## Installation

To set up the backend, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:

   Open your terminal and navigate to the backend directory of your project:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all necessary Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will create a `node_modules` directory and download all dependencies specified in `package.json`.

## Running the Backend Locally

To start the backend server locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch the backend server, typically configured to run on port 3000. You can access the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building the Project

To build the backend for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript (if applicable) into JavaScript and place the output in the `dist` directory.

## Environment Configuration

The backend relies on environment variables for configuration. You can create a `.env` file in the backend directory to specify these variables. Here is an example of what the file might include:

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
CACHE_TYPE=redis
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=redispwd0001
```

Ensure to replace these values with those relevant to your development or production environment.

By following this guide, you should be able to install dependencies, run the backend locally, and build the project successfully. If you encounter any issues, ensure all prerequisites are installed correctly and that your environment variables are configured properly.
